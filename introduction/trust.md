# Trust
Payment Method
In the traditional methods of payment, you had to trust to a payment system like PayPal, Visa, or MasterCard. In more modern methods that are based on cryptocurrencies, you might need to trust a third-party service to facilitate the payment process. However, they usually don’t offer direct payments, they verify the payments and then you can withdraw your money from your account on their website. Thus, whichever way you choose, there’ll always be a matter of trust included.

Using SubsCrypt, your payments are direct, without the need of any third-party to do it for you or  to verify your payments. Every subscription will have a transaction that holds the refund in the smart contract’s wallet and sends the rest directly to your wallet; Whenever a user’s subscription
period is over, you can withdraw the held money from the contract’s wallet. For verification, you yourself can check the data on the contract, or use our APIs to do it for you.
## Refund
As a customer, you had to dig into providers’ websites for information about their refund policies, then trust them on fulfilling their assurances. With the help of this project, you can easily check refund policies on the contract. The refund amount of the subscription plan will be held on the contract’s wallet and will be returned to you if you wish. The providers won't have access to that money and as a result, will not be able to spend it until your subscription period is over. Because of the transparency of the smart contract (the code is open-source and the transactions are on the blockchain), you won’t need to trust any third-party.
## Privacy
The old fashioned methods might store your purchase history and your private data about your preferences. SubsCrypt allows you to be anonymous and won’t store any additional data. When you are anonymous, your purchase history on different websites won’t be connected to your identity if you don’t want to, and can’t be used as a marketing technique.
