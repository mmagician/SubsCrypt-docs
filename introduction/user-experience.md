# User Experience
## Developer Experience
In the old days, a developer had to implement payment methods and databases for storing purchases and subscription data while we offer an easy to use API for creating subscription plans, verifying payments, and checking customers’ subscription status. You can also use our provider dashboard to check and manage your plans and your earning.
## Customer Experience
Nowadays, in order to manage your subscriptions, you need to visit your account on each provider’s website. For subscribing or renewing your old subscriptions, you need to follow methods chosen by each provider that can vary to a wide extent, and in some cases require you to share unnecessary information. SubsCrypt provides customers with an all-in-one dashboard where they can manage all their subscriptions of different websites and providers in one platform. Using this dashboard you can easily check all your subscriptions, refund, and renew them. In the times of making a payment on a provider’s website, you don’t need to remember any card info and the procedure will be uniform and straightforward everywhere. The only thing you need is an online wallet on your device. To identify your subscription on providers’ websites, (even on smart devices such as TVs) you only need a token and a passphrase, So you don’t have to type long wallet addresses on devices that are hard to type on.
