## Censorship
Discrimination is happening right now on several bases; people worldwide are facing national and international censorship by governments or big corporations that endanger their privacy and freedom of usage. By providing services on the blockchain, we can assure no discrimination(by any criteria) happens on using a service on our platform.
## Sanction
Sanctions are common in many countries. Because of that, many people canâ€™t even use online services because of their nationality or their country of residence. With the help of blockchain technologies and the users being anonymous, your residency will not be revealed. So you can pay for your subscription no matter where you are. Your access to these methods can not be manipulated by any government.
