## SubsCrypt for Providers
Let's assume that Sam is a VPN provider. He owns a wesite on which he provides different VPN subscription plans such as VIP, Premium and etc with different durations such as 1 week, 1 month,1 year and so on. In order to access services on Sam's wesite, users have to create an account. Then for purchases Sam uses PayPal which allow users to pay easily. However, he was forced to use a database to keep track of user payments and both Sam and the users had to trust the service that PayPal provides.

Today, Sam has decided to try using SubsCrypt. For starting, he has to register as a provider on our website. Then he will have access to his personal dashboard where he can manage all his subscription plans by adding new plans or disabling old ones. He can also check the number of users who have purchased each of his plans.

Every time any user makes a purchase, the refund amount will be kept in the contract's wallet and the rest of the money will be directly sent to Sam's wallet. After the subbscription duration is over or a user requests a refund, an amount of money might be left in the contract's wallet. Throgh his dashboard, Sam can check the amount of money he can receive, left from different subscriptions, and request to have it back, so after his request the money will be sent to his wallet.

For all this procedure to be working well, all Sam needs to do is to use our API and payment pop-up page to let the users pay for subscriptions through his web page by cryptocurrencies.

The pop-up page will look like below:
