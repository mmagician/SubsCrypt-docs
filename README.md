## SubsCrypt for Providers
Let's assume that Sam is a VPN provider. He owns a wesite on which he provides different VPN subscription plans such as VIP, Premium and etc with different durations such as 1 week, 1 month,1 year and so on. In order to access services on Sam's wesite, users have to create an account. Then for purchases Sam uses PayPal which allow users to pay easily. However, he was forced to use a database to keep track of user payments and both Sam and the users had to trust the service that PayPal provides.
